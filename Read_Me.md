# Apple Music Clone

A Flutter application that recreates the Apple Music experience on Android devices.

## Features

- Browse music content through featured playlists
- Search for songs, artists, and albums
- Library management
- Music playback with controls
- User interface similar to Apple Music

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Create the `assets/images/` and `assets/audio/` folders
4. Add your music files and cover art
5. Run the app with `flutter run`

## Dependencies

- Flutter
- just_audio
- audio_service
- cached_network_image

## Implementation Notes

This is a demonstration application that simulates the Apple Music interface. For a fully functional music player, you would need to:

1. Implement actual audio playback using the just_audio plugin
2. Connect to a real music API or use your own music files
3. Handle permissions for accessing device storage
4. Implement background audio playback using audio_service
